# Resources to Learn From
## [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html "This Book is Fire") by Michael Nielsen
  Amazing read, especially if you prefer a more indepth explaination validated with mathmatical concepts. Also has very examples, 
although the book is written in Python2, the same scripts updated to Python3 can be found [here](https://github.com/MichalDanielDobrzanski/DeepLearningPython35)
